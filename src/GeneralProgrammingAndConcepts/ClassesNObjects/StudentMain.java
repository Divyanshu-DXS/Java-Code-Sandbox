        * while the Class class method only works with 'public and default' constructors
        * 2. The Class class newInstance method only works with constructors that are visible.
        * However, the constructor class newInstance method can also work with private constructors in certain scenarios.
        * 3. When Class class newInstance invokes a constructor and throws an exception (checked or unchecked) will throw all the exceptions.
        * However, if the exception is thrown by Constructor class it throws only a single exception - InvocationTargetException
