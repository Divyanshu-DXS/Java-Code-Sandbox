# Lambda Fundamentals 

## Funtional Interface 

This is an interface with exactly one abstract method. There can be more default or static methods in it but precisely one abstract method. 

## Lambdas 

A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. 
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.


## Writing Lambdas has a few set of rules or building blocks: 
1. Supports only functional interface
2. You do not need variable types
3. you can rename variables 
4. you dont need parenthesis if the function has a single argument
5. if you have a single line of code you do not need {} or the return keyword
